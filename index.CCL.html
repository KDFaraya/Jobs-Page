            <p>
                Custodial work plays a vital role in maintaining the cleanliness and overall appearance of our campus. With the rising cost of tuition, CCL is always looking for ways to reduce expenses and offer affordable education to our students. One solution is to hire student staff to maintain the campus instead of outsourcing the work to third-party cleaning companies. We would like to save those fees and redirect the funds towards lowering the tuition. This would entail our staff to maintain hallways, bathrooms, and common areas. We want to make sure to protect our students by keeping our surfaces disinfected and sustain a healthy environment. CCL has amazing natural lighting and a wonderful view that student staff keep streak-free and shining brightly. Join our team to keep the campus clean!
